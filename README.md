# Why do we need a branch?

Because we can "clone" what we have done and make changes on this "cloned" copy!!!
Obviously, these changes will not influence the previous work

# Waste of time?

Nooooo!!We can merge the child branch back into the main "Tree"
With the help of Github, we can easily compare their difference~~~~~
